MiniChallenge: EightToTen - Endpoints

In this challenge, I created an endpoint that requires User to enter a question and it will generate an Eight Ball response to the question.
Created an endpoint to take an input of a restaurant category and randonly generate a restaurant from the category list.
Created three Endpoints that takes an integer guess and uses RNG to get a number and compare to the guess. Each endpoint is for each difficulty!
